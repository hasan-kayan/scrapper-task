    Asynchronous main function to fetch and store data for specified geographical bounds.

    This function defines a list of bounding boxes representing geographical areas
    and uses asyncio.gather to concurrently execute the `fetch_and_store` function
    for each bounding box in the list.

    The current implementation includes a bounding box for the USA as an example.

    Note:
        - The `fetch_and_store` function must be defined elsewhere in the code.
        - Additional bounding boxes can be added to the `bounds_list` as needed.
