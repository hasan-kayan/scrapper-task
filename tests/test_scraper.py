    Test the `fetch_and_store` function to ensure it retrieves and stores campground data correctly.
    This test uses a small geographic bounding box to limit the scope of the data fetched.
    It then verifies that at least one campground record is successfully saved in the database.
    Steps:
    1. Define a small bounding box (`test_bounds`) for testing purposes.
    2. Call the `fetch_and_store` function with the test bounds.
    3. Query the database to check if at least one campground record exists.
    4. Assert that a campground record is present in the database.
    Raises:
        AssertionError: If no campground record is found in the database.
